**What is a Generative Adversarial Network?**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of neural networks that are used for an unsupervised learning. GANs are made up of two neural networks, a discriminator and a generator. They use adversarial training to produce artificial data that is identical to actual data.

The Generator attempts to fool the Discriminator, which is tasked with accurately distinguishing between produced and genuine data, by producing random noise samples.
Realistic, high-quality samples are produced as a result of this competitive interaction, which drives both networks toward advancement.
GANs are proving to be highly versatile artificial intelligence tools, as evidenced by their extensive use in image synthesis, style transfer, and text-to-image synthesis.
They have also revolutionized generative modeling.
Through adversarial training, these models engage in a competitive interplay until the generator becomes adept at creating realistic samples, fooling the discriminator approximately half the time.
